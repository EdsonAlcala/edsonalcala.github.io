title:  "TuMenu"

I had the idea of a platform that enable restaurant owners a simple an easy way to create and publish their restaurant menu with the world by using a mobile application. I saw that a big problem for them was the cost of development and sometimes due to the size of the restaurant that option wouldn't be affordable. However, what if the cost of having one is very cheap?

The following are the characteristics I thought about the product:
- Simple
- Modern
- Intuitive
- Minimalist
- Elegant

## Technology

From a technical perspective, as new technologies like <a href="https://ionicframework.com/" target="_blank">Ionic</a> and <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react-native/" target="_blank">React</a> enable developers to build mobile applications with it. I was thinking in a standard and conventional way to create them by the usage of a kind of template and an automatic process for creating the packages for the different platforms. That kind of task can be performed by the usage of technologies like Powershell and a content management system for the different restaurants. I thought that by automating this process and creating a simple product platform, I could only worry about the future acquisition of customers.

However I still had to validate the idea. Would restaurant owners would be interested in a platform like that?

## Idea validation

In order to validate the idea I created a simple website and a simple app demo for a fictional restaurant called "El Buen Sabor". I then visited a couple of restaurant owners and had a little conversation with them. 

Unfortunately during those days I didn't have so much knowledge about research methods for designers and I didn't read many books like the <a href="http://momtestbook.com/" target="_blank">The Mom Test</a>. In fact I did many good things like the fast prototyping and the website because I avoid many expenses, however the research I conducted wasn't very good because I didn't do Ethnography studies and the interviews with potential customers were very bad and I didn't have any idea of what exactly I wanted or how can I convince the restaurant owner that it was a good product.

I think that by having a clear understanding of the difference between end users and customers would have save my life in those days. Also, I think I was very product focused instead of more human centred. Maybe by looking more closely to the problem and the frictions that I was trying to solve I could potentially discover more insights and find a different problem.
