Long time ago I wanted to learn more about being a Entrepreneur, how would the journey be like? I tried to do different things and I had a lot of ideas, however I always end up with very complex and large projects. I usually got demotivated in the middle of the journey. That make me think that I was losing the opportunity to finish a product and launch it. What would the lessons be once the product would be released? 

I decided to make a simple product and learn the process, my new interest was very interested in the innovation or complexity of the idea, I just wanted to make something that people would use and learn that process. 

Following that approach, I created Mp3Grabby, a simple high performance Youtube to Mp3 converter. It was load balanced with Nginx and I setup a set of Ubuntu servers hosted in Azure and AWS. The whole infrastructure consysted of 14 machines running in the cloud and managed by me and the magic of automation and continuos integration.
