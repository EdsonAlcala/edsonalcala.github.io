title:  "DemocraChain"
---

In collaboration with my lovely partner Yuxi Liu, we developed a smart contract based iot system for energy consumption.

The Democrachain concept emerged as an exploration of the Blockchain technology in the context of household energy consumption.

As the Blockchain promised decentralization and new forms of generation of value. We wanted to explore of Blockchain can empower different ways of governance and the implications of being part of a Distributed Autonomous Organization.

Every time I user wants to turn on the air conditioner, the request is stored in the Blockchain and it notifies all members of the organization to vote and decide if the current user could turn on the smart device.
