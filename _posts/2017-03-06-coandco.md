title: "Co & Co"

During my studies in Edinburgh I had the opportunity to collaborate with a young startup called Co&Co. The idea of connecting student body with opportunities and a platform to support multidisciplinary work appealed to me. Then we decided to build it.

I was in charge of the architecture, product and project management and I also mentored and coached members of the team.

## Requirements

At a high level the main features I could identify were:

- Dashboard with posts, opportunities and events
- Filtering
- Search functionality
- Messaging / Chat
- Notifications (In platform and Email)

## Technology

One of the biggest challenges at the beginning of the project was the technology selection. I didn't want to force or bias this decision by trends in the web stack or what the cool kids are doing. I tried to be pragmatic in the sense of the business domain requirements and I also considered broader aspects like the team capabilities (1 graduate junior developer and a 4th year graphic design student).

I had previous experience with <a href="https://angular.io/">Angular</a> and I felt really comfortable working with it, however I tried Angular 2 and some design decisions from the Angular team make me doubt so much about the future of the framework. I also considered <a href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a>, which looked very strong and there was a lot of community support but I didn't have any experience. After running a couple of proof of concepts and learned <a href="http://redux.js.org/docs/introduction/">Redux</a> and <a href="https://redux-form.com/7.1.1/">Redux Form</a>, I knew it was the way to go.

On the other hand, the backend and database selection would play an important role in the development of the project. To be honest I wanted to avoid going with ASP.NET Core, as my background with .NET technologies was extensive I wanted to try different technologies. Then, I ran some proof of concepts with <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">Node.js</a>, <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/" target="_blank">PostgreQL</a> and <a href="http://docs.sequelizejs.com/">Sequelize</a>. But I need to admit that the Sequelize migrations didn't work as much good as Entity framework and also the strongly typed C# characteristics make me thing that many errors would be avoided by selecting a typed language. On the other hand, the PostgreQL tools for development were not very good, I couldn't find something better than <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/ssms/download-sql-server-management-studio-ssms">SSMS</a>.

The final decision was React + ASP.NET Core + SQL Server.
