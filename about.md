Software Architect and Informatics Designer currently based in Edinburgh, Scotland. 

After finishing a Bachelor degree in Electronics, I decided to work in the software industry, where I collaborated in the development of digital products for web and mobile platforms. 

Passionate about technology and with a desire of continuous learning and self development, I moved to the United Kingdom to pursue a master degree in Design Informatics at The University of Edinburgh. 

During my studies I had the opportunity to learn emerging technologies and new ways of generation of value in current economies. I like to work at the intersection of art and technology with a human centred approach. 

Currently working and exploring new business models and value exchange between people and machine to machine with Blockchain technology and smart contracts.
